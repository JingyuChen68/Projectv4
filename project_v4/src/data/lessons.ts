        title: "Design Trade-offs & Decision Framework",
        content: "Embedded system design is all about trade-offs. Common ones: MCU vs FPGA (flexibility vs determinism), polling vs interrupt (simplicity vs efficiency), bare-metal vs RTOS (overhead vs schedulability), and wired vs wireless (reliability vs convenience). Interviewers love to hear structured decision-making.",
        code: `// Decision framework for interviews:
//
// 1. REQUIREMENTS
//    - Hard real-time deadlines?
//    - Power budget (mW? μW?)
//    - Unit cost target?
//    - Safety certification needed?
//    - Environmental conditions?
//
// 2. ARCHITECTURE SELECTION
//    Requirements          → Architecture
//    Simple, low power     → Super loop + sleep modes
//    Multiple deadlines    → RTOS with priority tasks
//    <1μs response         → FPGA or dedicated hardware
//    Safety-critical       → Redundant MCU + watchdog
//
// 3. COMPONENT SELECTION
//    Sensor accuracy vs cost vs power
//    MCU: peripherals needed, RAM/Flash, MHz, ecosystem
//    Connectivity: range, bandwidth, power, security
//
// 4. VALIDATION PLAN
//    Unit tests → Integration → System → Field
//    WCET analysis for real-time tasks
//    EMC/EMI testing for certification
//    Stress testing: temperature, voltage, timing margins`,

    keyTakeaways: [
      "Start with requirements and constraints — never jump to a solution",
      "Know the common architecture patterns and when to apply each",
      "Practice articulating trade-offs: cost, power, performance, complexity",
      "Always mention testing and validation — it shows engineering maturity"

Task: what was your specific responsibility. Action: what you personally did (use 'I', not 'we'). Result: quantifiable outcomes (saved X hours, reduced bugs by Y%, shipped on time).",

// SITUATION: "On my senior capstone project, our team was
// building a wireless sensor network for environmental
// monitoring. Two weeks before the demo, our custom PCB
// arrived with a critical routing error on the SPI bus."
//
// TASK: "As the hardware lead, I needed to find a way
// to get the boards working without time to respin."
//
// ACTION: "I analyzed the routing error using the
// schematic and identified two crossed traces. I designed
// a rework procedure using wire jumpers, documented it
// step-by-step, and personally reworked all 5 boards.
// I also added DRC checks to our review process."

        title: "Common Behavioral Questions & Frameworks",
        content: "Top companies (Tesla, Apple, Qualcomm, TI) ask behavioral questions to assess culture fit, problem-solving approach, and communication skills. Prepare 4-5 diverse stories that cover: technical challenge, teamwork/conflict, tight deadline, learning from failure, and leadership/initiative. Each story should map to multiple question types.",
        code: `// Story Bank Strategy:
// Prepare 5 stories, each mappable to 3+ question types:
//
// Story 1: "Debugging the intermittent CAN bus failure"
//   → Tell me about a difficult bug you solved
//   → When did you have to be persistent?
//   → How do you approach debugging?
//
// Story 2: "Convincing the team to switch from Arduino to STM32"
//   → Tell me about a time you influenced others
//   → When did you make an unpopular decision?
//   → How do you evaluate technology choices?
//
// Story 3: "Shipping the IoT prototype in 3 weeks"
//   → How do you handle tight deadlines?
//   → Tell me about a time you went above and beyond
//   → How do you prioritize when everything is urgent?
//
// Questions to ask YOUR interviewer:
// - "What does a typical project lifecycle look like?"
// - "How does the team handle hardware-software integration?"
// - "What's the most interesting technical challenge right now?"
// - "What testing infrastructure do you have?"`,

        tips: [
          "Quantify results whenever possible: 'reduced latency by 40%' beats 'made it faster'",
          "Practice out loud — behavioral answers should be 90-120 seconds, no rambling",
          "Have a failure story ready — what matters is what you learned and changed",
