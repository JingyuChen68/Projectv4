        title: "Reading Timing Diagrams",
        content: "Timing diagrams show how digital signals change over time. They're essential for understanding protocols (SPI, I2C, UART), verifying setup/hold times, and debugging with oscilloscopes. Each horizontal line represents a signal, time moves left to right, and transitions show rising/falling edges. Interviewers often ask you to draw timing diagrams for protocol transactions or to identify problems in existing ones.",

        content: "Block diagrams are the language of system-level thinking. In an interview, you'll often be asked: 'Design a system that does X.' Start with a block diagram showing: power supply, MCU, sensors, actuators, communication interfaces, and user I/O. Use arrows to show data flow and label each connection with the protocol (SPI, I2C, GPIO, etc.). Include power rails and ground. A clear block diagram demonstrates you can think at the system level before diving into details.",

A memory map shows how the address space is divided: Flash at 0x0800_0000, SRAM at 0x2000_0000, peripherals at 0x4000_0000 (for a typical STM32). Register layouts show individual bits within a peripheral register — which bits control what function. Being able to read a datasheet register description and write code to configure it is a core embedded skill.",

        content: "In 1997, the Mars Pathfinder rover experienced repeated system resets after landing. The cause was a classic priority inversion bug in its VxWorks RTOS. A low-priority meteorological task held a shared mutex that a high-priority data bus task needed. A medium-priority communication task would preempt the low-priority task, preventing it from releasing the mutex, which starved the high-priority task and triggered the watchdog timer. The fix was enabling priority inheritance on the mutex — something the VxWorks RTOS supported but the engineers hadn't turned on. NASA engineers uploaded a patch from Earth to fix the running software on Mars.",

The machine had two modes: low-power electron beam and high-power X-ray. A race condition in the control software allowed the high-power beam to fire without the required metal target in place, delivering 100x the intended radiation dose. Contributing factors included: removal of hardware safety interlocks (relying solely on software), inadequate testing, poor error handling (cryptic 'MALFUNCTION' messages operators learned to ignore), and no independent safety monitoring. This case fundamentally changed how safety-critical software is developed.",

        content: "On June 4, 1996, the Ariane 5 rocket self-destructed 37 seconds after launch. The cause was a software bug in the inertial reference system: a 64-bit floating-point number (horizontal velocity) was converted to a 16-bit signed integer. The value exceeded 32,767, causing an overflow and a hardware exception. The backup system had the identical software, so it failed simultaneously. The navigation system interpreted the error as flight data, triggered corrective maneuvers for a non-existent trajectory deviation, and the rocket broke apart from aerodynamic forces. The software had been reused from Ariane 4, where the velocity values were smaller and the conversion never overflowed.",

        title: "Toyota Unintended Acceleration",
        content: "Between 2000-2010, Toyota vehicles experienced unintended acceleration incidents linked to software in the engine control module. Expert analysis by NASA and embedded systems experts revealed: 10,000+ global variables with no protection, spaghetti code with recursion depths that could overflow the stack, insufficient use of volatile qualifiers, no RTOS memory protection between tasks, inadequate watchdog implementation (single-point-of-failure), and a safety architecture that violated MISRA C guidelines. Toyota settled for $1.2 billion. The case became a landmark for automotive software safety standards (ISO 26262).",

It exploited four Windows zero-day vulnerabilities to spread, then specifically targeted PLCs running particular Step 7 configurations. The malware subtly altered centrifuge motor speeds (between 1,410 Hz and 2 Hz) while reporting normal values to the monitoring system. It damaged roughly 1,000 centrifuges. Stuxnet demonstrated that industrial control systems and embedded devices are vulnerable to targeted attacks, fundamentally changing how we think about embedded security.",

(2) Technical phone screen — 45-60 min, coding or concept questions over video call, often involving C programming and basic embedded concepts. (3) On-site/virtual loop — 4-6 hours, typically includes: a coding round (C/C++, algorithms), a system design round, a hardware/debugging round, and a behavioral round. Some companies add a take-home project (design a simple embedded system). (4) Team match — some companies do a final cultural fit conversation. The entire process typically takes 2-6 weeks.",

        content: "Embedded whiteboard problems are different from typical software interviews. You might be asked to: design a device driver, implement a circular buffer, draw a state machine, debug a timing issue from a scope trace, or design a simple embedded system. The approach: (1) Clarify requirements — ask about constraints (memory, speed, real-time requirements). (2) Draw a diagram first — block diagram for system design, state diagram for FSMs. (3) Write pseudo-code before real code. (4) Talk through edge cases: what happens during power-on, overflow, error conditions? (5) Discuss testing — how would you verify this works?",

Follow this framework: (1) REQUIREMENTS — ask about performance, power, cost, safety, environment. (2) ARCHITECTURE — draw a block diagram with MCU, sensors, actuators, power, comms. (3) COMPONENT SELECTION — justify your MCU choice, sensor choice, protocol choice. (4) SOFTWARE DESIGN — task decomposition, state machines, data flow. (5) TRADE-OFFS — discuss what you'd do differently with more time/money. (6) TESTING — unit tests, integration, HIL, field testing. Spend about 5 min on requirements, 10 min on architecture, 15 min on details, 5 min on testing.",
        tips: [
          "Budget your time: don't spend 20 minutes on requirements — keep it focused",

(2) Ignoring hardware — discussing only software when the system involves sensors, power, and physical interfaces. (3) No error handling — writing the happy path only and not considering what happens when things fail. (4) Overcomplicating solutions — using an RTOS when a simple state machine would work, or adding unnecessary abstraction layers.

SPI: 4+ wires (MOSI/MISO/SCLK/CS), sync, master-slave, up to 50+ MHz, full-duplex, fast but needs one CS per slave. I2C: 2 wires (SDA/SCL), sync, multi-master/multi-slave, 100/400kHz/1MHz, addressable, fewer wires but slower. CAN: 2 wires (differential), async, multi-master, 1 Mbps, message-priority arbitration, automotive standard, robust noise immunity.
